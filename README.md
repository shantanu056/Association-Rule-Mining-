# Association-Rule-Mining-

In this project we had to 'Determine the highest associated items which can be strategically placed together and marketed effectively to improve the sales of a retail clothing store.'

The dataset included multiple clothing products.

The project proceeded in the following sequence-
* I installed 'mlxtend' library.
* Used TransactionEncoder to convert data into a DataFrame
* Applied Apriori algorithm to find frequent itemsets
* Generated association rules with confidence >= 0.6
* Narrowed down the result to important columns
* Concluded with the highest associated products to satisfy the business need.
